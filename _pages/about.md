## About Me
I am a PhD student in the department of political science and at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interests include American political institutions, oversight, and influence in legislative politics.

My work has appeared in journals such as _Scientific Data_ and _Scientific Reports_, as well as in policy outlets like _The Commonwealth Fund_.
