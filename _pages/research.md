## Working Papers
[``The Politics of Predicting the Future.''](https://lowande.polisci.lsa.umich.edu/future.pdf) (with Kenneth Lowande).

Congress negotiates with vast uncertainty about the effects of proposed policies, and so
relies on committees to report about the past and project the future. Little is known about
their conclusions, their accuracy, and whether politics seeps into their judgements. We
introduce a typology of informational statements contained in committee reports, which
classifies them based on whether they are prospective or retrospective, and whether they
contain an inference. We argue that bipartisan teams tend to focus on the past to avoid
disagreements inherent in predicting out-of-sample. Using a new dataset of committee
reports from the 106th-116th Congress, we identify and classify summary findings, evaluations, predictions, and recommendations. We show that bipartisan teams are more retrospective and fact-based, while partisan teams favor predicting the futureâ€”without making actionable recommendations. Our results demonstrate politics drives partisan teams
to systematically communicate less accurate (and helpful) classes of information.

[``Consequences of the Medicaid Coverage Gap''](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hee98sp6pl38qv6xox31u/glied-weiss2024.pdf?rlkey=sahsifw6rnljisc0rv4efdquq&e=1&st=9t3lbad9&dl=0) (with Sherry Glied).

Nearly two million low-income Americans fall into the Medicaid coverage gap: they
earn too much to qualify for Medicaid in their state but too little to qualify for subsi-
dized insurance under the ACA, leaving them with no affordable coverage options.
The existence of the gap is well-known, but there have been few systematic studies of
its impacts. Using data from the 2011-13 and 2017-19 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil-
lance System (BRFSS) across 36 sample states (and, in sensitivity analyses, from the
2011-2019 American Community Survey), we study the effects of state Medicaid ex-
pansion decisions on rates of health insurance coverage, having a personal doctor,
and preventive service utilization among those who fall into the gap. We find that
Medicaid expansion is associated with improvements in all three outcomes among
those who would otherwise fall into the coverage gap (the potential gap population).
We then examine the extent and sources of heterogeneity in these patterns. We find
that the effects of expansion on the gap population vary in magnitude (though not
in direction) across specifications and sample state selection. We find that hetero-
geneity in effects is systematically associated with characteristics of expansion and
non-expansion states included in the analysis, although the relationships vary across
populations and outcomes. This heterogeneity suggests that analysts examining pat-
terns across states should test for the robustness of effects across samples.
